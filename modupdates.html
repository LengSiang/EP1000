<p>I learnt to use a raster graphics tool, GIMP to edit my photo. I was able to remove the background of the image and subsitute it with a scenic image. It was achieved using the selection tool to isolate myself from the original image and the selected area was feathered.</p>
                <p>Here are the orignal image and edited image as well as screenshot of the GIMP workspace. </p>

                <p>Next, I learnt to use a vector graphics tool, Inkscape to create a vector image of a cat. It was done using the Bezier drawing tool to outline the cat in the original photo. Finally, a colour was added to complete the simple cat silhouette.  </p>

                    a. A 2-point rectangle with rounded sides is first created as the base of the name tag.<br>
                    b. A rim is created around the edges by sketch and extrusion.<br>
                    c. Then, a key-ring hole is made by creating a skethe, join extrusions and cut extrusions.<br>
                    d. To create the embossed name on the base, the texts are typed out and extruded upwards. This sums up the simple name tag modelling process.
                </p>
                <p><b>TIP!</b><br>If you are modelling your name tag, you could actually type emojis onto your name tag! I found some cool emojis <a href="https://emojicombos.com/">here</a>&nbsp, however they may not be compatible with all font types. If the emoji you copied and paste does not look the same as the original, change to a font that can produce the emoji.</p><br>

                        a. A 2-point rectangle is first drawn and extruded to form a cuboid of the standard lego dimension, according to a Youtube <a class="selected" href="https://youtu.be/6yPKMSb6ja8">video</a> by Kevin Kennedy.
                        b. Next, a circle is sketched on the top of the cuboid at one corner and join extruded to create the first bump of the lego.<br>
                        c. Using the rectangular pattern command, the circular bump feature is duplicated 3 times across one side length of the top of the rectangular object. A pattern has been created on one half of the rectangle.
                        The first pattern is duplicated once to create the same 4 bumps on the other top half of the rectangle.<br>
                        d. The bottom of the cuboid is then hollowed out using the 'shell' tool.<br>
                        e. A circular brim is then created in the hollowed side to make one of those centre collumns underneath legos that make them attach to one another. It was also created by sketch and extrusion.<br>
                        f. A rectangular pattern command is used to duplicate the circular extrude 2 times along the length of rectangle, resulting in 3 centre collumns.<br>
                        g. Finally, 2mm-fillets are created on the outer edges of the lego.
                    </p>
                    <p><b>TIP!</b><br>If you have also done the lego, go to Solid > Modify > Appearance to add a material type and colour to your lego. Lastly, switch from the design interface to the render interface (at the top left of Fusion360) and render your lego as a photorealistic-looking image file.</p><br>

                    b. In front view, a small triangle is sketched inside the top right corner (could be left too). Using the Z-axis as the rotation axis, the triangle is revolve-cut to create the hex nut shape.<br>
                    c. The revolve-cut feature is mirrored over a plane placed along the centre, 5mm above the XY plane.<br>
                    d. A countercunk tapped hole of size 12mm is created in the centre of the hexagon. The thread type is GB metric profile and designation is M12x1. Hex nut is competed.

                    a. A knight chess piece side view sample sotck image is downloaded. <a href="https://www.canstockphoto.com/knight-chess-16964310.html">Here</a>&nbsp you will find the image example of the knight. The JPG file is then imported to Fusion360 as the reference photo for the knight. <br>
                    b. The profile outline  of the knight is sketched using spline command.<br>
                    c. The base of the knight is a circular solid created using revolve command and the rest of the knight sketch is extruded to create a body.<br>
                    d. More extrusions are made to cut away parts to make the knight's body gradually slope outward from the head down, like a real knight piece which should be thicker down and smaller at its top.<br>
                    e. Loft cut tool is used to create concaves on the side of the knights snout. More extrusions are made to shape the nose.<br>
                    f. A nosetril hole is made by creating a sphere and after placing it at the certain location, is join-cut from the knight's nose.<br>
                    g. A certain triangle is extruded from the top of the knight's head to create a pointy ear.<br>
                    h. To create the engraved stripes on the side of the knight, a pipe is created to certain length and width, and extruded outwards. The feature is duplicated across the knight's side at a certain slant to create the stripes. It is done using pattern on path. The join-cut command is then used to remove the pipes and the engravement is done.<br>
                    i. The mirror command is used to mirror the half-body knight and now the knight's upper body is completed where both sides are identical.<br>
                    j. The lower body of the knight is rounded by using loft with intersect and tangent edge selected after some sketches done. <br>
                    k. Since the knight was modelled to a rather small scale due to the small sized canvas/referenceimage, it is finally scaled to a size of the average real life knight chess piece. 
                </p>
                <b>TIP!</b><br>You can definitely learn a lot about 3D drawing in Fusion360 and master it by watching some advanced tutorials on Youtube. I would never have thought this knight is possible if I hadn't learnt so many tricks from this <a href="https://youtu.be/LoecnnaVLH4">video</a>. I think all we need to do is to have a clear picture of what we want to model, and to look from all angles at the possibilities to model it in order to learn about the usefulness of all the different commands in Fusion360. We should really be experimenting a lot with the different commands and just search on Youtube when we have doubts. If you find a good timelapse video, just lower the playback speed in the settings.</p><br>

                <p>After all the CAD involving 3D modelling, it's time to dive straight into fabrication and so I 3d printed some of the models made with Fusion360. Using Ultimaker Cura as my preferred slicer, I applied the information learnt in class to experiment with 3D printing and obtain the desired print results. </p><br>

                <p>Printer used: Cubicon Style</p>
                <p>How it's made:<br>
                  a. The CAD of the name tag is exported into an STL file from Fusion360.<br>
                  b. The STL file is imported into the Ultimaker Cura slicer and sliced using the following custom settings:<br><br>
                  &nbsp&nbsp • Layer height: 0.1mm<br>
                  &nbsp&nbsp • Infill density: 30%<br>
                  &nbsp&nbsp • Infill pattern: Grid<br>
                  &nbsp&nbsp • Build plate adhesion type: skirt<br><br>
                  The small layer height of 0.1 mm was meant to produce a finer print with good resolution and smoothness. 
                  The purpose of a higher-than-average infill of 30% was to make the print relatively stronger given it is a very thin piece of name tag.
                  The infill pattern I selected is the grid, as will be for all my 3D prints because grid pattern typically offers greater print strength.
                  Knowing that the 3D printer that I use - Cubicon Style - has specially coated heating bed which allows easily detachable prints, I chose to apply skirt as the build plate adhesion type instead of brim or raft. <br><br>
                  <a href="images/slicedNameTag.jpg"><img src="images/slicedNameTag.jpg"height="450px"/></a><br>
                  c. As a standard procedure, the sliced g-code is then renamed to a HVS file to be transferred to the Cubicon Style printer via SD card. After about an hour, the print is done.<br><br>

                  The small layer height of 0.075 mm was meant to produce a very fine print with high resolution and nice smoothness. 
                  The average infill amount of 25% was to give the print average strength.
                  As there were overhangs in the model to be printed, support was enabled for all 50° overhangs.

                <p>How it's made:<br>
                  a. The CAD of the knight is exported into an STL file from Fusion360.<br>
                  b. The STL file is imported into the Ultimaker Cura slicer and sliced using the following custom settings:<br><br>
